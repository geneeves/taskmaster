TaskMaster is a light, simple to-do-list notepad written and tested in Javascript, and designed by hand with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap responsiveness. Built for [Epicodus Fall 2013](http://www.epicodus.com) during the first month of class.

You can use the app [here](http://geneevesco.site44.com/taskmaster/index.html), or feel free to clone. It won't save your lists or tasks permanently, so don't reload the browser unless you want a clean slate! Working on this project was primarily about learning object oriented JS, and moving around elements with jQuery.  

Enjoy! Hope you get some things done with it.


Notes for next steps: 
 
 .set tasks as incomplete so that you can prioritize etc
 
 .delete tasks and lists
